This project is an incident response simulation training tool.  The intention is to help prepare students for the world of IR.  Given the nature of IR, it can be very difficult to teach in a classroom environment.  This project aims to help bridge that gap.  Currently, the goal is to create multiple virtual environments that the end user will be placed into randomly as well as multiple pieces of malware that will be randomly selected each time this program is run.  The intent behind this randomization is to most closely simulate an incident in a realistic fashion.

This project can also be used to both test and train new hires in the incident response.  Having the ability to gauge a new hires skills allows for the company to best tailor a plan to improve their skills.

This project can also be used by an individual hoping to teach themselves some IR skills.
